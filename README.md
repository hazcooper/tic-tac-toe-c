# Tic‑Tac‑Toe (C)

This repository provides a simple two‑player Tic‑Tac‑Toe game written in C.
Players take turns entering positions on a 3×3 grid until one achieves
three in a row (horizontally, vertically or diagonally) or the game ends
in a draw.  The project is designed to be easy to compile and run on any
Unix‑like system and showcases proficiency with C syntax, arrays and
control flow.

## Compiling and Running

```
gcc -o tictactoe tictactoe.c
./tictactoe
```

Enter the row and column numbers (1‑3) when prompted.  The board will
display after each move.  Invalid inputs are handled gracefully.

## Motivation

Although small, this project demonstrates fundamental concepts in C such
as loops, functions, arrays and user input handling.  It’s a classic
exercise often used to showcase understanding of C programming when
applying for systems or embedded software roles.
